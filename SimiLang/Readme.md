# So, this is the SimiLang folder.
*This is not finished yet.*
*It was an Idea, that should compile from .sim to .simx32, and .simx32 SimiOS can execute.*
*Something like a .exe on windows.*
*It has an own commandline based text editor, written in C++*

# The Simx32 compiles a .sim to .simx32; C++
# The SimiOS Simx32 To Kernel (SSTK) should compile (not finished yet) .simx32 to a function in my kernel; C
# The SimEdit should be a text editor for SimiOS; C++
